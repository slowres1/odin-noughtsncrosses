# odin-noughtsncrosses
Noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) game learning project.
Completed!
If i were to come back to this I'd probably add some stuff for displaying which player's turn it was and some proper modals for error messages etc. But that's mostly optional bonus stuff!
Core bit is done. Likely that my code is fairly messy, and still not quite grasping the whole private/public split, especially for variables.
